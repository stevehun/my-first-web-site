    <span id="first" class="js">The microbiota</span> consists of all living members forming the microbiome. 
    Most microbiome researchers agree bacteria, archaea, fungi, algae, and 
    small protists should be considered as members of the microbiome. 
    The integration of phages, viruses, plasmids, and mobile genetic elements is 
    more controversial. <span>Whipps's</span> "theatre of activity" includes the essential role 
    secondary metabolites play in <span class="js">The microbiota</span> mediating complex interspecies interactions and 
    ensuring survival in competitive environments. Quorum sensing induced by small 
    molecules allows bacteria to control cooperative activities and adapts their 
    phenotypes to the biotic environment, <span class="js">The microbiota</span> resulting, e.g., in cell-cell adhesion 
    or <span>biofilm</span> formation.
