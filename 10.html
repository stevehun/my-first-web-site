<strong>creating <u>web</u> pages</strong> and web applications.
<p>A microbiome (from Ancient Greek μικρός (mikrós) 'small', and βίος (bíos) 
'life') is the community of microorganisms that can usually be found living
together in any given habitat. It was defined more precisely in 1988 by
Whipps et al. as "a characteristic microbial community occupying a 
reasonably well-defined habitat which has distinct physio-chemical 
properties. The term thus not only refers to the microorganisms 
involved but also encompasses their theatre of activity". </p>

<p style="margin-top:45px;">In 2020, an international panel of experts published the outcome of 
their discussions on the definition of the microbiome. They proposed a 
definition of the microbiome based on a revival of the "compact, clear,
and comprehensive description of the term" as originally provided by 
Whipps et al., but supplemented with two explanatory paragraphs. 
The first explanatory paragraph pronounces the dynamic character of 
the microbiome, and the second explanatory paragraph clearly separates 
the term microbiota from the term microbiome.</p>
